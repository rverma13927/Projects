This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the Redis Pub/Sub messaging system in Java using the Jedis library. The project consists of two main components:

    Publisher: Sends messages to a Redis channel.
    Subscriber: Listens for and receives messages from a Redis channel.

The example shows how to establish a Redis connection, publish messages to a channel, and handle incoming messages using the JedisPubSub class.

The time complexity of Redis Sorted Sets (ZSET) operations depends on the internal data structures that Redis uses to implement them. Redis Sorted Sets are backed by a combination of a skip list and a hash table. Each of these structures enables efficient read and write operations on the elements and their scores.
Key Operations and Their Time Complexities:

    ZADD: Adding or updating an element in a sorted set.
        Time Complexity: O(log N), where N is the number of elements in the sorted set.
        Explanation: Redis needs to insert the element into the skip list and update the hash table, both of which are logarithmic time operations.

    ZREM: Removing an element from a sorted set.
        Time Complexity: O(log N).
        Explanation: Deletion from both the skip list and hash table takes logarithmic time.

    ZINCRBY: Incrementing the score of an element in a sorted set.
        Time Complexity: O(log N).
        Explanation: This operation involves removing the element from its current position and reinserting it with the new score, which takes logarithmic time.

    ZSCORE: Getting the score of an element.
        Time Complexity: O(1).
        Explanation: The score is stored in a hash table, allowing for constant-time access.

    ZREVRANGE: Getting elements in a specific range, ordered by score in descending order.
        Time Complexity: O(log N + M), where M is the number of elements in the result set.
        Explanation: Finding the starting point in the skip list takes logarithmic time, and then traversing through M elements is linear in M.

    ZRANK / ZREVRANK: Getting the rank (position) of an element.
        Time Complexity: O(log N).
        Explanation: Redis needs to traverse the skip list to find the rank of the element.

    ZRANGE / ZREVRANGE with WITHSCORES: Getting elements in a specific range along with their scores.
        Time Complexity: O(log N + M).
        Explanation: Similar to ZREVRANGE, finding the starting point takes logarithmic time, and returning M elements is linear in M.

    ZCOUNT: Counting the number of elements within a score range.
        Time Complexity: O(log N).
        Explanation: Redis locates the start and end points in the skip list, which takes logarithmic time.

    ZRANGEBYSCORE / ZREVRANGEBYSCORE: Getting elements in a score range.
        Time Complexity: O(log N + M).
        Explanation: Finding the start and end points in the skip list takes logarithmic time, and returning M elements is linear in M.

Why is the Time Complexity O(log N)?

The logarithmic time complexity for most operations is due to the underlying skip list data structure. A skip list is a linked list with additional layers that allow for logarithmic-time operations like search, insert, and delete by "skipping" over multiple elements at each level.

    Skip List Height: The average height of a skip list is proportional to log N, where N is the number of elements in the list.
    Insertion and Deletion: These operations involve traversing the skip list and modifying pointers, both of which take O(log N) time.

Summary of Time Complexities:
Operation	Time Complexity
ZADD	O(log N)
ZREM	O(log N)
ZINCRBY	O(log N)
ZSCORE	O(1)
ZRANK / ZREVRANK	O(log N)
ZREVRANGE	O(log N + M)
ZRANGEBYSCORE	O(log N + M)
ZCOUNT	O(log N)
Use Case Consideration

Due to these time complexities, Redis Sorted Sets are highly performant and scalable for operations like real-time leaderboards, ranking systems, and priority queues. Operations like ZADD and ZRANK can handle millions of elements efficiently due to their O(log N) nature.
