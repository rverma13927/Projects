This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the Redis Pub/Sub messaging system in Java using the Jedis library. The project consists of two main components:

    Publisher: Sends messages to a Redis channel.
    Subscriber: Listens for and receives messages from a Redis channel.

The example shows how to establish a Redis connection, publish messages to a channel, and handle incoming messages using the JedisPubSub class.
