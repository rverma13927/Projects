1. **Core Structure**:
    - Uses a file-based storage system with two meta pages for atomic updates
    - Implements a simple key-value store with read and write transactions
    - Uses file channels and random access files for I/O operations

2. Key Classes:
    - [MiniBoltDB]
    - [ReadTransaction]
    - [WriteTransaction]
3. Main Features:
    - Thread-safe with `ReentrantReadWriteLock`
    - Atomic commits using a two-meta-page approach
    - In-memory index with disk persistence
    - Simple record format: key-length + key + value-length + value

4. Example Usage:
   ```java
   try (MiniBoltDB db = new MiniBoltDB(new File("mini_bolt.db"))) {
       // Write transaction
       try (WriteTransaction wt = db.beginWrite()) {
           wt.put("key", "value".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
           wt.commit();
       }
       
       // Read transaction
       try (ReadTransaction rt = db.beginRead()) {
           byte[] value = rt.get("key");
           // use value
       }
   }
   ```





The meta pages in MiniBoltDB are essential for ensuring data consistency and atomic updates. Here's why they're important:

1. **Atomic Updates**:
    - The database maintains two meta pages (meta0 and meta1) to implement a double-write pattern
    - When updating the database, it writes to the meta page that wasn't used last time
    - This ensures that at least one valid meta page always exists, even if the system crashes during a write

2. **Crash Recovery**:
    - On startup, the database reads both meta pages and uses the one with the higher transaction ID
    - This guarantees that after a crash, the database will recover to the last consistent state

3. **Consistency**:
    - Each meta page contains a pointer to the current index
    - The index is only updated by writing a new copy and then atomically updating the meta page
    - This ensures readers always see a consistent view of the data

4. **Transaction Safety**:
    - The meta page includes a [txid](cci:1://file:///C:/Users/DSV/Desktop/Java/hotel-booking-system/src/main/java/com/example/hotel/bbolt/mini_bolt_db.java:268:8-268:43) (transaction ID) that increases with each write
    - This helps in determining the most recent valid state
    - The commit process is atomic because the meta page update is a single disk write

Here's the relevant code that handles meta page selection and updates:

```java
private int chooseNextMetaSlot() throws IOException {
    Meta m0 = readMetaAtSlot(0);
    Meta m1 = readMetaAtSlot(1);
    return m0.txid >= m1.txid ? 1 : 0; // write to the other slot
}
```

The key benefit is that this approach provides ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) even with simple file operations, making it resilient to crashes and power failures.



Let me clarify how the hashmap is handled in this implementation:

1. **In-Memory Hashmap**:
    - Used for fast lookups (O(1) time complexity)
    - Stays in RAM while the database is running
    - Provides instant access to key locations

2. **On-Disk Storage**:
    - The hashmap is serialized to disk during [commit()](cci:1://file:///C:/Users/DSV/Desktop/Java/hotel-booking-system/src/main/java/com/example/hotel/bbolt/mini_bolt_db.java:295:8-312:9)
    - Stored as a binary blob at the end of the file
    - The meta page points to this serialized index

3. **Why Serialize the Hashmap?**
    - **Persistence**: To survive application restarts
    - **Consistency**: Ensures the index matches the data file
    - **Recovery**: Allows the database to rebuild its in-memory state

4. **The Trade-off**:
    - **Pros**:
        - Simple to implement
        - Fast for small to medium datasets
        - Easy to understand and maintain
    - **Cons**:
        - Must load entire index into memory
        - Not suitable for extremely large datasets
        - Write amplification (rewriting the entire index on each commit)

5. **Better Approaches for Production** (not implemented here):
    - B+ trees (used in real databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL)
    - LSM trees (used in LevelDB, RocksDB)
    - Partitioned indexes

For learning purposes, this implementation is great, but for production use with large datasets, you'd want a more sophisticated on-disk structure.
